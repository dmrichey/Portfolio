            <p>The game board consists of five tiles, referred to as screens, which contain a sample of art from the original game, a legend relating die rolls to objects within the game, and a list of the objects needed to progress to the next screen. On a player's turn, they roll a set of six dice in an attempt to gather the required objects to progress. The turn can consist of multiple rolls, limited only by the rolling of "torches" - a result of 1 on a given die. If at any point the player does not roll any torches, their turn ends and play progresses. When a player completes the fifth screen, all players receive one last chance to reach the end. If, after this final round, multiple players have cleared the fifth screen, then those players each roll a set of six dice and sum the totals, representing the treasures they claimed from the Castle. The player with the highest total wins. </p>

    <h3>My Contributions:</h3>
    <p>I developed the fight with the final boss of the level, Mortifer.</p>
    <p>During the fight, Mortifier switches between circling the arena and attacking the player. He has four attacks which he can choose from: a three-hit projectile combo which does a small amount of damage; a single, large projectile which does a large amount of damage; a melee attack in which the boss teleports behind the player and strikes them with his demonic arm; and a grapple attack which becomes available after the boss has been reduced to less than half health that does a large amount of damage while healing the boss.</p>
    <p>The model for Mortifier and the animations used during the fight were found on Mixamo. The particle effect tied to his teleport and projectiles was created by me.</p>

<h2>Outcast Party RPG</h2>
<div class="concept">
    <div class="text">
        <p>This concept is centered around a party of characters who are initially viewed as outcasts, but by the end of the game are shown to be, for good or ill, the world's only hope. The party members meet in prison, awaiting execution for various crimes they may or may not have committed. The cast of characters are as follows:</p>
        <p>Aile is a teenage half-devil, an orphan who grew up on the streets of one of the major cities in the region. Having survived from a young age by stealing, she drew the attention of a thieves' guild within the city. Possessing an impulsive, naive worldview, Aile often gets herself into trouble.</p>
        <p>Grussh has known Aile for most of their lives, and has had to deal with the trouble she causes for nearly as long. A half-orc brawler, Grussh has spent his life combatting the image of orcs as uncivilized brutes, and is the closest thing to a voice of reason this party has.</p>
        <p>Virardens is an elven mage with more than a drop of draconic blood within his veins. He has many ideas that would improve the world around him. Unfortunately, most of these ideas end, quite literally, in flames.</p>
        <p>The last member of the party is the player character. This character, however the player decides to modify their backstory, is bound to an eldritch spirit: a voice in their head which often drives them to act against their best interest, to lash out against those who abuse their power or harm their friends.  </p>

<h2>The Fall of Tranquility</h2>
<div class="concept">
    <div class="text">
        <p>An uneasy truce exists between the nations of Feltrys, at least until a mysterious cult begins to sabotage the very fabric of society. Demonic Rifts, famine, failing magic, and the seeds of civil war threaten the delicate balance of forces that sustain existence. When these hidden threats begin to reveal themselves, a party of heroes forms to combat them, and stop the world from falling into chaos.</p>
        <p>The player takes on the role of one of these heroes, whether by choosing from one of six premade characters with their own backstories, unique abilities and interactions, or by creating their own character. The player then travels with a party of up to three other characters, directing the rest to aid in stabilizing other regions. </p>
        <p>A mechanic that would be implemented behind the scenes within the game to provide a sense of urgency and show the devolving state of the world is known as Chaos. Chaos is a value which increases as the player performs actions within the game at a rate determnined by the player's efforts to combat the Chaos. Chaotic actions, for example, would cause the Chaos value to increase faster, while completing quests that provide stability to the world would cause this value to increase more slowly. This value would modify the appearance of the game world, the chances of random spawns, and even the difficulty of the game's final boss.</p>

When he was found again, in his home a week later, rambling about the things he had seen, everyone believed him to have gone insane from the stress of crafting his play, and he was sent to an asylum, where he obtained a book full of arcane secrets. Having escaped the asylum, he now seeks to find the motive of the cult, and stop them before it is too late.</p>

<h2>Dystopian Future RPG with Dragons</h2>
<div class="concept">
    <div class="text">
        <p>This dystopian future state sees a tech supergiant take control of almost all facets of the world. A genetic research facility, attempting research into recombining the DNA of multiple organisms to generate species that could better withstand the conditions of the overly-urban, heavily-polluted world, is acquired by the authoritarian tech company and forced to make creatures that can be easily weaponized through the addition of cybernetic enhancements. After discovering the means to create dragons, the lead geneticist's research is stolen and he is killed.</p>
        <p>The player takes on the role of the geneticist's child, who was entrusted with the only viable dragon specimen which has ever been produced. After keeping the creature hidden for almost 15 years, it is proving nearly impossible to keep the dragon secret any longer, and rather than letting it be taken by the tech company, the player will attempt to take down the authoritarian regime created by this tech company with the help of the only true dragon.</p>
        <p>Most dragons produced within this world are not capable of surviving on their own, and are therefore modified to some extent dependent on their state of development with cybernetic enhancements to augment their survivability and to make them easier to control.</p>

        <p>The last siege was almost three millenia ago. Humanity has spread far from the walls of Bastion, and many have become accustomed to life without the threat of demon attacks. But the Vigil, Bastion's elite organization of mages and warriors, devoted to the protection of the Mortal Realm from any threat, have recently found evidence that the demons may be returning.</p>
        <p>The player takes on the role of one of these Vigilants, Rasviel Cordratus, and his party of fellow adventurers, investigating the potential return of the demons, and attempting to stop the coming of another Siege.</p>

<h2>Fantasy Metroid-vania</h2>
<div class="concept">
    <div class="text">
        <p>Telathris was located at the Convergence, the point at which the three Axes of Power met. This location gave the inhabitants of the city access to a great deal of magical power, which they used to become the center of military, technological, magical, and cultural power. But through their exploitation of the Convergence, they weakened the Veil Between – the natural magical barrier that separates the Mortal Plane from the demiplanes of higher beings. As a result of the weakened Veil, the Archdemon Kerashivaol was able to Pierce into the Mortal Plane, opening a Rift through which his army of demons was able to escape from the Demonic Plane. </p>
        <p>The arrival of demons in the city of Telathris prompted the King to contact the neighboring cities for aid. The five surrounding cities sent their mages to create a perimeter a number of days travel from the city; at the same time the King created a barrier around the city itself. The mages intended to lock the city and the area surrounding it in stasis, preventing the flow of time and limiting the casualties within the area, to buy time to gather a large enough force to combat the invasion. They underestimated the speed of the demons, however, and were interrupted before the intended spells could be completed. </p>
        <p>The interrupted rituals created a burst of power which devastated the region outside of the Barrier, which became a blasted crater of white crystal and dust known as the Wastes. The sealing of the city also resulted in the sealing of the Convergence and the weakening of all three Axes of Power. This resulted in disaster for the four cities which relied on the Axes to fuel their magic and thus all of their technology. The only city spared this fate and the need to completely restructure their ways of life was the City of Iron, which had always been wary of the Axes and the Convergence.</p>

        <p>Within the Barrier, the city of Telathris fell into chaos. The attempted stasis brought the Solar and Lunar Axes into line, resulting in a total eclipse above the Convergence, plunging the city into twilight. This also caught the attention of Helios, God of Day and Nyx, God of Night. These beings, who initially worked together to combat Kerashivaol and his forces, have resorted to fighting over who will control the Convergence once the Barrier falls. Their factions – the Vigilant Dawn and the Court of Twilight – attempt to protect the people of Telathris while appeasing their gods.</p>
        <p>The Inner Seal, created by the King to slow the spread of the demons prevented entry and escape from the city to any not carrying the King’s Seal, but succeeded in keeping the bulk of the demons from spreading beyond the city itself. </p>
        <p>Twenty years after the fall of Telathris, the Iron Legion decided to attempt to reclaim the city and seal the rift created by the demons entering this world. They sent a forward scout, one of the only people to escape the region before it was sealed, to determine the state of the region. The player takes on the role of this scout, and explores the demon infested ruins of Telathris.</p>
