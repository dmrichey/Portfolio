                            <p>Summary: Arx Mysterium is a 2D roguelite platformer combining the combat and movement of modern Metroid-vanias like Blasphemous and Axiom Verge with the randomized room and item placements characteristic of roguelites like Hades and Binding of Isaac.</p>
                            <p>Tasked with uncovering the secrets of a mysterious tower, the player must use whatever they find to reach the upper levels of the tower and defeat the malevolent creature within.</p>

                            <p>The purpose of this prototype, in addition to acting as a presentation of progress on the project, is to identify a solid mechanical base for the rest of the game to build on. The single short level included in the prototype showcases a combination of the platforming and combative gameplay elements the player can expect to encounter in the full game in a streamlined environment which allows for testing focused specifically on these mechanics. Through this testing, we can determine whether the game possesses a solid enough base to iterate upon for a full game.</p>
                            <p>Through future development, the game will see the introduction of more roguelite elements, including more room types and a randomized room order, items and powerups to modify gameplay on a given playthrough, and permanent upgrades to help the players become stronger through multiple playthroughs. These inclusions will expand on the current mechanics to add greater variety to the game and bring it closer to the end goal of a completed game.</p>

                            <p>My role in the development of this project was as a programmer introducing functionality for the "explore" sections of the game.

Once the player has obtained the necessary information, the game can transition into the "minigame" sections, which make up the bulk of the gameplay.</p>
                            <p>Due to the platform on which this game was built - that being an HTML/Javascript web app - a different approach was needed to implement the movement of the player and the scrolling of the background in this game than would be needed to achieve the same effect in a more conventional engine. To achieve this, the screen is comprised of multiple containers, each moving at different speeds according to their order in layer and based on the distance of the player from the edge of the screen to achieve a parallax effect. Combining this with a global coordinate for the player's and other entities' positions within the level allows the player to interact with the NPCs. </p>

                            <p>As lead programmer on Rosa, I was responsible for the development of the character's movement controls, as well as for the implementation of the various interactable components within the game's levels. The first of these interactable objects is the lore collectibles which the player can find scattered throughout the game. The purpose of these collectibles is to expand on the atmosphere of the game and to provide a greater sense of mystery as the player attempts to piece together the story behind the game. The information gathered from these collectibles can be reviewed through the journal found in the pause menu.</p>
                            <p>The other two types of interaction make up the puzzle component of the game. The first of these is the box object, which when interacted with is attached to the player until either the player releases the box or it is moved onto the designated receptacle. The second puzzle involves pressing buttons in a given order. The given requirements to complete any level can be learned by interacting with the door at the end of the level. All of these forms of interaction exist for the purpose of leading the players to explore the game's various levels, and to challenge the player's navigational abilities.</p>

                            <p>The project, in the state it was in when my team was brought on board to help, contained most of the base mechanics the client wanted for the game, as well as a large play area with some interesting features. This version of the game did not, however, give the player much information about the game's mechanics or much direction towards how to play the game. Without this information, a player is likely to grow bored with the game before being able to identify what makes the game fun to play. In order to remedy this, we endeavored to establish a new level design that would slowly introduce the relevant mechanics to the player, and add to this a simple tutorial which could help explain controls and introduce mechanics, allowing the player to more quickly identify the fun in the game, increasing player retention.</p>
                            <p>In the initial version of the game, the player was given control of a mostly established colony of pigeons, with nests built and multiple birds to control. This initial colony was established in a relatively open area of the map with little safety to learn about the game before engaging threats. The updated version starts the player with only a single pigeon in a relatively safe area of the map, and uses tutorial tooltips to walk the player through establishing their first colony. Once the player has completed this initial walkthrough, the player is then encouraged to explore more of the map, with additional tutorial popups informing the player of other mechanics such as the threat of humans or the need for food.</p>

                            <p>My contribution to this project was the design and implementation of the player controller, including movement, camera control, and the two abilities the player has access to. A third person camera was important to the design, as we wanted the player to be able to view more of their surroundings, and the ability to look around and assess the situation without moving the character itself enables the player to better plan their escape. Two potential movement speeds for the player - implemented through a sprint function - allows the player to have more control of their movement, giving them the opportunity to move slowly and methodically or more quickly as their playstyle and the situation in-game demands.</p>
                            <p>The player has access to two special abilities - a vision modifier reminiscent of thermal vision and an invisibility effect. These abilities serve two purposes within the game to aid in the player's ability to spot threats and avoid detection. The use of the thermal vision allows the player to better notice enemies which could spot them by highlighting the enemies and their sight cones in red. The invisibility allows the player to briefly avoid detection, giving them a chance to recover from a difficult situation in which they would normally be spotted. Each of these abilities only lasts for a short duration, after which the player must wait before being able to use their abilities again. This prevents overuse of the abilities which could make the game too easy, while still allowing the players to take a more strategic approach to their escape. </p>
